# Android SDK Best Practices for 2025

> _Modern Android SDKs should be modular, testable, and developer-friendly._

In 2025, the bar for quality SDKs is higher than ever. Developers expect **easy integration**, clear documentation, and robust architecture that avoids common pitfalls.

## ✨ Why Care About SDK Best Practices?

A great SDK is:

- Easy to drop into any app
- Configurable without hacks
- Testable with unit and integration tests
- Stable across versions

Poorly designed SDKs increase **app size**, **crash rates**, and **developer frustration**.

## 🗂️ Recommended Architecture

> Modular. Testable. Decoupled.

A proven approach is using **MVVM** and **clean separation of concerns**.

### 🔹 Use MVVM

Separating UI logic from business logic makes your SDK easier to test and integrate:

```kotlin
@HiltViewModel
class MyViewModel @Inject constructor(
    private val repo: MyRepository
) : ViewModel() {
    val state = mutableStateOf("")
}
